            As it can be understood from the <a href=" {{ url_for('allocation') }} ">allocation page</a>, the allocation model is based around taking user inputs/preferences
            regarding ESG criteria, risk, and specific sectors/stocks in order to produce an equity portfolio. Once this input
            is gathered by the forum questions of the page, the allocation model uses them to produce an "efficient" set of
            allocations based on two main theories and methodologies: Markowitz Modern Portfolio Theory & the Black-Litterman
            Model.

        <h3>Black-Litterman Model:</h3>
        <p>
            The Black-Litterman model is used to produce the returns of the stocks as well as the covariance matrix
            to be used in the mean-variance optimization. The actual model built and used here is based on Attilio Meucci's
            implementation, which uses mathematically equivalent and computationally more stable equations for the posterior
            returns and covariance matrix. These are found using the log daily returns of the stocks as the "investor views,"
            which are necessary for this model since it incorporates future expectations.

        <h3>Markowitz Modern Portfolio Theory:</h3>
        <p>
            Once the returns and covariances are calculated, a mean-variance optimization is done to find an efficient allocation
            that minimizes the portfolio variance. Additionally, the objective function also includes a risk-aversion parameter
            and a return parameter to give this mind and not only variance alone. This way, investor preference on risk
            can also be taken into account by input. A weight of 0-5 can be given for this risk-aversion parameter, to either
            put less or more emphasis on the return of the portfolio to overtake the variance minimization. Lastly, the ESG
            criteria is implemented through portfolio score constraints given the user input on their care for each ESG pillar.
